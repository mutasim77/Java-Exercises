## Introduction

Welcome to the Java-Exercises repository! This project contains a collection of solved exercises from a Java textbook used at a university. The exercises cover various topics and concepts introduced in a first-year Java course, including data types, loops, and object-oriented programming. These solutions can be used as a reference or guide for anyone working through the same exercises. I hope you find this repository helpful!ðŸ¤—
