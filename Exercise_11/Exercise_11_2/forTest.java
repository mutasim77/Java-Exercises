/*

(The Person, Student, Employee, Faculty, and Staff classes) Design a class named Person and its
two subclasses named Student and Employee. Make Faculty and Staff subclasses of Employee. A person
has a name, address, phone number, and email address. A student has a class status (freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior).
Define the status as a constant. An employee has an office, salary, and date hired. Use the MyDate class defined in Programming
Exercise 10.14 to create an object for date hired. A faculty member has office hours and a rank. A staff member has a title.
Override the toString method in each class to display the class name and the personâ€™s name.

Draw the UML diagram for the classes and implement them. Write a test pro- gram that creates a Person, Student,
Employee, Faculty, and Staff, and invokes their toString() methods.
